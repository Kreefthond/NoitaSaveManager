A Noita save manager. I'll add a better description if people are actually interested.

It features multiple saves at the same time by copying your active save file to the applications path. You can set a custom name for your save as well. Restoring should also work fine.

It does not refresh itself after saving, as well as deleting a save. ( you can remove the folder from the .exe location )


I made this as a learning experience using ChatGPT alot. I can try to add some features but I've been using it as it is for a while without any issues.
